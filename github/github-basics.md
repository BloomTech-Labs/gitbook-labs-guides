# GitHub Basics

## The Labs GitHub Org

Lambda Labs maintains a GitHub organization \([https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs)\) which houses all of the Labs projects \(with few exceptions\) that are built by student teams during Labs.

### The Basics

* All repositories are [publicly accessible](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/setting-repository-visibility) and licensed under [The MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
  * This effectively means that the code in the repositories belongs to the world; Lambda School simply maintains the organization to keep the code accessible and organized.
* Only Lambda School Engineering Managers will have the role of Owner in the organization, everyone else will have the role of Member
  * The Member role has very limited permissions and will only be able to access repositories that are specifically assigned to the user, directly or through Teams. Work with an Engineering Manager for any administrative tasks

### GitHub Teams

Member permissions for teams are generally granted using [Teams](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/organizing-members-into-teams). This allows individual member permissions to be more easily maintained and made consistent. A GitHub team will be created for each Labs team with a specific naming convention to identify the team: `<Cohort>-<Team Letter>-<Product Name>` \(e.g. `Labs 26 - A - Apollo`\).

* There will be one team per project, per cohort.
* The APL, TPL and all students that are part of the project will be members of this team.
* Teams will be deleted shortly after the Labs cohort ends.
  * This means Team members will lose direct access to the code in the Labs org... but don't worry! The code is public and MIT licensed, so you can fork away to continue working on the code!

To be a member of a Team, you must be a member of the Organization that the Team is part of. If this is your first time on a Labs team, Labby will invite you to be a member of the Labs GitHub Organization. This invite _should_ arrive in the email that is associated with your GitHub account. If it doesn't, check your spam filter folder. If it's not there, you _should_ be able to see the invite in your GitHub notifications tab: [https://github.com/notifications](https://github.com/notifications)

If you think you should have an invite, but can't find it, please talk to a Section Lead or Tech Lead.

## FAQ

* Why am I being automatically subscribed to new repositories?
